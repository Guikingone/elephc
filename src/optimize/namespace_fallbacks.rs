//! Purpose:
//! Applies resolver-recorded namespace fallbacks during the second pre-check target fold.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `fold_constants_for_target`, `fold_expr`, and first-class callable folding.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - The symbol snapshot includes surviving conditional declarations, not just eager functions.
//! - Other folding passes do not reconsider function bindings.
