//! Purpose:
//! Canonicalizes loop shells during control-flow normalization: `for` loops without an update
//! clause become `while` loops, `do ... while (true)` becomes `while (true)`, leading
//! `if (...) { break; }` guards fold into the loop test, trailing `continue` statements are
//! dropped, and an unconditional loop that ends in a break guard rotates into `do { ... } while`.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::optimize::control::prune::statements::prune_stmt()` for `While`, `DoWhile`, and `For`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Every rewrite moves nodes instead of cloning them, so no span-keyed checker decision is duplicated.
//! - Guard folding keeps PHP evaluation order: the guard runs exactly where the body used to test it,
//!   after the loop test and only when that test passed, on the first entry and after every `continue`.
//! - Rotation into `do ... while` refuses bodies with a `continue` targeting the loop, because that
//!   `continue` skips the trailing guard today but would reach the rotated test.
