//! Purpose:
//! Coordinates conservative whole-program declaration reachability after AST DCE.
//! Owns the public pruning options and the AST/metadata reconciliation boundary.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::pipeline::compile()` and codegen fixture pipelines before EIR lowering.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - The pass removes declarations only after a fixed-point reachability proof.
//! - The AST and `CheckResult` are pruned together so lowering cannot resurrect dead methods.
