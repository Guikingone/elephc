//! Where a `private` method actually lives.
//!
//! PHP resolves `private` by the LEXICAL SCOPE, not by the receiver's class: inside `C::m()`, a
//! value typed as a SUBCLASS of `C` still reaches `C`'s private methods, because a private method
//! is not virtual and belongs to the class that declared it. Class flattening deliberately does
//! not inherit private methods into a subclass's table (`ClassLikeState::inherit_methods`), so a
//! subclass-typed receiver found nothing at all.
//!
//! MEASURED against php 8.5.10, with no `instanceof` involved:
//!
//! ```php
//! class P {
//!     private function secret($s) { return 'S' . $s; }
//!     public function viaSelf() { $o = new C(); return $o->secret('a'); }
//! }
//! class C extends P {}
//! echo (new P())->viaSelf();      // php: Sa      elephc: Undefined method: C::secret
//! ```
//!
//! Private PROPERTIES never had the gap -- `inherit_properties` copies them whatever their
//! visibility and `can_access_member` then admits the declaring scope -- so this is the method
//! half of a rule the compiler already applies to the other kind of member.
//!
//! Three passes need the same answer and each resolves members on its own: the checker types the
//! call, the IR lowering reads the signature to materialize omitted optional arguments, and
//! codegen picks the body to call. Missing it in the checker refused the program; missing it in
//! the IR lowering emitted `2 operands for 4 ABI params`. They ask here so they cannot disagree.
