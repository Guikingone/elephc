//! Purpose:
//! Emits `__rt_mixed_numeric_add/sub/mul`, PHP arithmetic over boxed Mixed operands.
//! Carries PHP's integer-overflow promotion and its numeric-string classification.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::codegen_wasm::runtime::emit_command_runtime()`, after the mixed and float
//!   runtimes whose `__rt_mixed_unbox`, `__rt_mixed_from_value`, `__rt_str_to_int`, and
//!   `__rt_str_to_f64` helpers it calls.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Operand classification follows php-src, not the operand's static type: `"7" + 5` is
//!   an integer while `"7.0" + 5` is a double.
//! - A non-numeric operand is a PHP `TypeError`. WebAssembly has no exception machinery
//!   yet, so it is reported as an uncaught fatal and exits 255; catching it needs W2.
