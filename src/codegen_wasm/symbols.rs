//! Purpose:
//! Defines the injective WebAssembly symbol ABI for PHP functions, methods,
//! closure bodies, and compiler-generated wrappers or dispatch stubs.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::codegen_wasm::function` selects the symbol for each EIR function.
//! - Call, object, method, and closure lowering use the category-specific helpers.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - PHP names are encoded through `crate::names::mangle_fqn`; no character is
//!   discarded, so distinct source names remain distinct.
//! - Every semantic category owns a disjoint prefix. A user-controlled name can
//!   therefore never impersonate a compiler-generated wrapper or dispatch stub.
