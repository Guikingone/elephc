//! Purpose:
//! Home of the PHP `interface_exists` builtin: its single-source registry declaration and semantic target.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - Checker, EIR, optimizer, ownership, and callable consumers through `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - The check hook validates that the first argument is a string literal and the
//!   optional autoload argument is a literal bool or int (AOT constraint).
//! - Arguments are pre-inferred by the registry common path before the hook runs.
