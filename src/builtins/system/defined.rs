//! Purpose:
//! Home of the PHP `defined` builtin: its single-source registry declaration and semantic target.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - Checker, EIR, optimizer, ownership, and callable consumers through `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - `check` validates that the argument is a string literal (AOT requirement: the
//!   constant name must be statically known at compile time).
//! - The semantic effect includes `MAY_THROW` because invalid relative class
//!   receivers raise catchable PHP `Error`s during static lowering.
