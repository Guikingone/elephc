//! Purpose:
//! Home of the PHP `constant` builtin: its single-source registry declaration and semantic
//! metadata.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - Checker, EIR, optimizer, ownership, and callable consumers through `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - `check` mirrors `defined()`'s AOT contract: the constant NAME must be a compile-time string
//!   literal. It also resolves the constant so the call's result type is the constant's own type
//!   (`int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, `null`) instead of `mixed`.
//! - An unknown name is a COMPILE error here, where reference PHP raises
//!   `Error: Undefined constant "X"` at runtime. A binary with no constant table cannot look the
//!   name up, and refusing at compile time is strictly more informative than a runtime fatal.
//! - Class constants and enum cases (`constant('Foo::BAR')`) are NOT supported: the name is
//!   resolved through the global constant table only.
//! - Lowering happens one level up, in
//!   `crate::ir_lower::expr::constants::lower_static_constant_call()`, which rewrites the call
//!   into the same EIR a bare `FOO` reference produces. The registry lowering hook below is a
//!   guard for paths that bypass that rewrite.
