//! Purpose:
//! Home of PHP's cycle-collector controls — `gc_enabled`, `gc_enable`, `gc_disable` and
//! `gc_collect_cycles` — as the constants an elephc program can honestly answer.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - Checker, EIR, optimizer, ownership, and callable consumers through
//!   `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - elephc frees by REFERENCE COUNT and has no cycle collector to turn on, so `gc_enabled()`
//!   is `false`, `gc_collect_cycles()` collects nothing and reports `0`, and the two switches
//!   are no-ops. Reporting `true` instead would be the more "PHP-default-like" answer and the
//!   wrong one: it would promise a collector that is not there.
//! - The whole family has to exist together, because the callers use it as a pair — Symfony's
//!   `AbstractCloner::cloneVar` does `if ($gc = gc_enabled()) { gc_disable(); } … gc_enable();`
//!   — and a program that finds `gc_enabled()` and then no `gc_disable()` fails one line later
//!   than one that finds neither.
//! - Each folds to a constant at compile time; there is no runtime helper to call.
