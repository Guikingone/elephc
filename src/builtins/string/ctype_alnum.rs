//! Purpose:
//! Home of the PHP `ctype_alnum` builtin: its declaration and semantic metadata.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - Checker, EIR, optimizer, ownership, and callable consumers through
//!   `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - No `check` hook is needed: `ctype_alnum` is a pure-data builtin whose return type
//!   (`Bool`) is fully determined by its declaration. The registry derives the
//!   return type from the `returns:` field without calling a check hook.
