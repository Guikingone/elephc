//! Purpose:
//! Home of the PHP `count_chars` builtin: its declaration and semantic metadata.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - Checker, EIR, optimizer, ownership, and callable consumers through
//!   `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - php-src's return type is `array|string`, chosen by the `$mode` VALUE: modes `0`, `1`,
//!   and `2` build a byte-value keyed tally, while modes `3` and `4` render the used or
//!   unused bytes as a string. elephc compiles ahead of time, so `$mode` has to be an
//!   integer literal (constant folding runs before the checker, so a named constant still
//!   qualifies).
//! - A mode outside `0..=4` keeps the tally shape here and the backend raises php-src's
//!   catchable `ValueError` before the helper runs, so the runtime function is declared
//!   `MAY_THROW` rather than pure.
