//! Purpose:
//! Home of the PHP `str_replace` builtin: its declaration and semantic metadata.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - Checker, EIR, optimizer, ownership, and callable consumers through
//!   `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - The declared signature includes an optional `count` param, but `max_args: 3`
//!   caps arity so only three arguments are accepted, matching PHP's practical use.
//! - The declared `string` return is only right for a STRING `$subject`. php answers an array
//!   for an array `$subject`, and `subject_shaped_result_type` is what tells the checker and
//!   EIR that — see its own comment for the miscompile it closes. `str_ireplace` shares it.

/// Returns `array<string>` for an array `$subject` and `string` for every other subject.
///
/// php: `str_replace(array|string $search, array|string $replace, string|array $subject,
/// int &$count = null): string|array` — "if `$subject` is an array, then the search and replace
/// is performed with every entry of `$subject`, and the return value is an array as well."
/// Measured on 8.5.10: `str_replace(["a"], ["1"], ["ab", "ba"])` is
/// `array(0 => '1b', 1 => 'b1')` and `gettype()` of it is `array`; the subject's KEYS are
/// preserved (`["k" => "aa"]` answers `["k" => "11"]`).
///
/// This existed only in the backend. `lower_string_replace` has had an array-subject path
/// calling `__rt_str_replace_array_subject_arrays` for a while, but the contract declared
/// `returns: Str` and the semantics took it verbatim, so the call site stored an ARRAY pointer
/// into a string slot. Measured before this resolver, on the identical source php answers the
/// two-element array above with:
///
/// ```text
/// $r = str_replace(["a"], ["1"], ["ab", "ba"]); var_dump($r);   // string(2) "b1"
/// ```
///
/// — a silent wrong answer, not a diagnostic. The same wrong type is what refused
/// `[$a, $b] = str_replace($search, $replace, $subjects)` with "List unpacking requires an array
/// on the right-hand side": the checker was told the right-hand side was a string.
///
/// The array arm deliberately matches the backend's own predicate in `lower_string_replace`
/// exactly — `Array(Str | Mixed)`, nothing else. An `AssocArray` subject is NOT claimed here:
/// the backend has no array-subject path for one and falls through to its string handling, so
/// promising an array result would re-create the mismatch this resolver removes. Every other
/// subject, gradual ones included, keeps the declared `string` it has always had.
