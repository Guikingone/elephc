//! Purpose:
//! Home of the PHP `array_diff` builtin: its single-source registry declaration and semantic target.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - Checker, EIR, optimizer, ownership, and callable consumers through `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - The PHP golden signature is `variadic(&["array"], "arrays")` (one regular `array`
//!   param plus a variadic `arrays`). The legacy CHECK arm required exactly 2 arguments,
//!   so `min_args: 2, max_args: 2` reproduce that enforcement in `check_arity` only;
//!   `function_sig` and the parity gate keep the variadic shape from the golden.
//! - `check` accepts concrete and gradual array operands. Concrete inputs preserve
//!   their shape, while gradual inputs keep their conservative type until the runtime
//!   array guard selects the active representation.
