//! Purpose:
//! Home of the PHP `key` builtin: its single-source registry declaration and semantic target.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - Checker, EIR, optimizer, ownership, and callable consumers through `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Returns `null` once the internal pointer has run past either end of the array.
//! - The receiver's internal pointer lives in a compiler-allocated cursor slot beside the
//!   array local, so the argument must be a plain variable. Both that rule and the
//!   argument-type rule are shared with the other five pointer builtins in
//!   `crate::builtins::array::internal_pointer`.
