//! Purpose:
//! Defines the `BuiltinSpec` type that describes a single PHP builtin function:
//! its name, arity, type signature, and shared backend-neutral semantics.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::builtins::registry` (collected via `inventory`).
//! - Checker, optimizer, EIR lowering, ownership, callable, and runtime consumers
//!   through `crate::builtins::semantics`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Every builtin must submit exactly one `BuiltinSpec` via the `builtin!` macro;
//!   duplicate names are detected at registry init time.
//! - All `BuiltinSpec` fields are `'static` so the struct can be used in `const` context
//!   and stored in the `inventory`-collected registry without allocation.

// Checker hooks are public registry metadata but intentionally receive the crate-private
// checker implementation rather than exposing compiler internals as public API.
