//! Purpose:
//! Home of the PHP `gettype` builtin: its declaration and semantic metadata.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - Checker, EIR, optimizer, ownership, and callable consumers through `crate::builtins::registry`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Pure-data builtin with no check hook; arity and arg inference are handled by the registry common path.
