//! Purpose:
//! Caches assembled slice objects by the CONTENT of the slice, so a rebuild that
//! changed nothing in a slice never runs the assembler over that slice again.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::linker::assemble_parallel()`, once per contiguous slice produced by
//!   `crate::linker::asm_split`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - The key is the FNV-1a of the RENDERED slice text, not of a byte range of the
//!   input. A rendered slice already carries its section replay, its promoted
//!   renames and its own visibility footer, so it is self-contained: two runs that
//!   render the same string must assemble to the same object.
//! - The assembler is part of the key. `/usr/bin/as` on macOS is a shim that execs
//!   clang, so the bytes it produces track the installed Command Line Tools; the
//!   tool's path, its arguments, its length and its modification time all go in.
//! - This is a DIFFERENT cache from the runtime object's and lives in its own
//!   directory, so `runtime_cache::storage`'s canonical-name matcher can never
//!   match a slice object and the runtime cache's bound of eight entries can never
//!   evict one.
//! - Publication is atomic (unique temporary, then rename) and an FNV integrity
//!   sidecar is verified before any reuse, the same shape as `runtime_cache`.
//! - Every failure here is silent and falls back to assembling. A cache that
//!   cannot be read or written must make the next build slower, never wrong.
