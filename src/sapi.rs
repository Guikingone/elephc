//! The compile-time SAPI, published once per compilation and consulted by the front end.
//!
//! `--web` decides more than the process entry point. PHP's own front end behaves differently
//! per SAPI *before a single token is scanned*: the CLI removes a leading `#!` line from every
//! file it compiles, and a web SAPI emits those bytes as inline HTML like any other text before
//! `<?php`. Measured on php 8.5.10, on a file spelling `#!/usr/bin/env php` then
//! `<?php echo "hi\n";`:
//!
//! ```text
//!                       primary script      included file
//!   php file.php        hi                  hi              <- the line is gone
//!   php -S (both)       #!/usr/bin/env php  #!/usr/bin/env php
//!                       hi                  hi              <- the line is output
//! ```
//!
//! So the rule is not "the first file" -- it is the SAPI, for the whole compilation. Every PHP
//! CLI entry point carries that line (`bin/console`, `phpunit`, `composer`), which is why this is
//! a standard-PHP concern and not a framework one.
//!
//! Held thread-locally, like `source`'s parse mode, because one test process compiles both `--web`
//! and CLI programs and a process-global would let them overwrite each other. `pipeline::compile`
//! publishes it on the dedicated compile thread that then owns the whole front end.
