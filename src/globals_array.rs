//! Purpose:
//! Models PHP's `$GLOBALS` superglobal as a compile-time alias onto ordinary
//! global storage. A literal-key access `$GLOBALS['name']` is rewritten by the
//! parser into a single variable whose name is the *alias* produced by
//! [`alias_name`]; every later phase then treats it as an ordinary variable that
//! happens to live in `_eir_global_name` storage, exactly like a variable
//! imported with `global $name;`.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::parser::expr::prefix::parse_variable` (rejects a bare `$GLOBALS`),
//! - `crate::parser::expr::pratt` (rewrites `$GLOBALS['name']` to an alias),
//! - `crate::ast_usage` (collects the aliased global names of a program),
//! - `crate::ir_lower::context::LoweringContext` (routes an alias to global
//!   storage and interns the *target* name as the global symbol),
//! - `crate::ir_lower::function::collect_global_var_names` (keeps a top-level
//!   `$name` and a function's `$GLOBALS['name']` on the SAME storage),
//! - `crate::types::checker` (types an alias without an `Undefined variable`).
//!
//! Key details:
//! - The alias spelling `GLOBALS[name]` cannot collide with a real PHP variable:
//!   `[` is not valid in a PHP identifier, so no user program can declare it.
//!   That is what makes this sound where a naive `$GLOBALS['x']` -> `$x`
//!   desugaring is not — PHP keeps a function's local `$x` and `$GLOBALS['x']`
//!   strictly separate, and an injected `global $x;` would fuse them.
//! - Only keys that are valid PHP variable names are aliased. Every other shape
//!   (dynamic key, bare `$GLOBALS`, whole-array assignment) is rejected LOUDLY
//!   at parse time rather than silently miscompiled.
