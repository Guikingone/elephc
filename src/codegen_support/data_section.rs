//! Purpose:
//! Collects constants and common storage declarations before serializing the assembly data section.
//! Deduplicates string, float, and common symbols used by expression and runtime-facing emitters.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::codegen` and shared expression/statement emitters.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Labels must stay stable within one compilation because code emission references them before final serialization.
//! - `.comm`'s alignment operand is target-dependent and must follow the object format, not the
//!   host: Mach-O reads it as a power-of-two exponent, ELF as a byte count. Emitting one spelling
//!   everywhere silently under-aligns every common symbol on ELF, which the assembler accepts and
//!   the linker then rejects with `relocation truncated to fit` for any 64-bit access.
