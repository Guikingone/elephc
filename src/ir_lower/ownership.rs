//! Purpose:
//! Provides small helpers for explicit EIR ownership operations during
//! AST-to-EIR lowering.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::ir_lower::stmt` and `crate::ir_lower::expr` when values cross
//!   assignment, call, and cleanup boundaries.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Ownership and semantic value copies use explicit EIR opcodes consumed
//!   by the active backend; lifetime pins are not PHP value assignments.
