//! Purpose:
//! Injects the two elephc-PHP helpers that back PHP's `(object)` cast:
//! `__elephc_cast_object` (the statically non-object source) and
//! `__elephc_cast_object_dynamic` (a runtime-typed source that may already hold an object).
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::pipeline::compile()` and the codegen test harness via `inject_if_used`, AFTER
//!   `autoload::run`, so `ir_lower::expr::lower_cast` can lower a `(object)` cast to an
//!   ordinary call to the injected declaration.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Implemented as a prelude rather than a runtime helper because PHP's conversion is a
//!   key walk plus dynamic property writes — both already exist as ordinary elephc-PHP, so
//!   every supported target gets the cast with no per-target assembly (the same reason
//!   `var_export_prelude` is a prelude).
//! - PHP's rules, reproduced exactly: an array becomes a stdClass whose property names are
//!   the array's keys rendered as strings; `null` becomes an empty stdClass; every other
//!   non-object value becomes a stdClass with a single `scalar` property; an object is
//!   returned UNCHANGED (same instance, not a copy).
//! - The split into two helpers is what keeps the cast's static type precise.
//!   `__elephc_cast_object` is declared `: stdClass` and is what `lower_cast` calls when the
//!   source cannot be an object, so `(object) ['a' => 1]` types as `stdClass` and property
//!   reads stay on the nominal path. Only a `mixed`/union source needs the `: mixed`
//!   `__elephc_cast_object_dynamic`, because the object it returns unchanged may be of any
//!   class.
//! - Pay-for-use: injected only when the program spells an object cast anywhere, detected
//!   through the shared exhaustive walk in `opcache_prelude::detect` rather than a second
//!   traversal of its own.
//! - Injection runs LATE, past the pipeline's own name-resolution pass, because the cast is
//!   detected syntactically and an autoloaded class file is not part of the AST before
//!   `autoload::run`. The declarations are name-resolved on the way in, the way `autoload::run`
//!   resolves the files it splices.
