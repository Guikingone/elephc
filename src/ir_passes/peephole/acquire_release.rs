//! Purpose:
//! Paired acquire/release cancellation peephole: drop an `Acquire` whose result
//! is consumed only by a matching `Release`.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::ir_passes::peephole::Peephole::run` via `collect`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - `Acquire` persists/increfs a value; `Release` frees/decrefs it. When the
//!   acquired result is used exactly once and that single use is its `Release`,
//!   the pair is refcount-neutral on every path (allocate-then-free or
//!   incref-then-decref with nothing observing the copy in between), and the
//!   acquired operand is untouched. Both instructions are neutralized.
//! - The single-use guard makes this safe regardless of how far apart the two
//!   ops are or which path the `Release` sits on: the value flows to exactly one
//!   `Release`, so removing both cannot leak or double-free.
//! - It does NOT make the raised refcount unobservable, which is why an `Acquire`
//!   carrying the lifetime-pin marker is skipped: such a pair exists precisely
//!   because something between the two ops may release the value's other owner
//!   (issue #580).
