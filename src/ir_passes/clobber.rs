//! Purpose:
//! Classifies which EIR opcodes and terminators are "volatile-safe": their
//! `codegen` lowering emits no call and touches only the fixed result and
//! scratch registers, never the caller-saved registers the allocator may hand
//! out to non-call-crossing intervals.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::ir_passes::intervals` to mark each live interval as call-free.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Safe-by-default in the correctness direction: the allowlist returns `true`
//!   only for opcodes whose lowering was audited to (a) emit no `bl`/`call`,
//!   (b) clobber a register set contained in {result, x9/x10/x11 and d0/d1 on
//!   AArch64; rax/rdx/rcx/r10/r11 and xmm0/xmm1 on x86_64}, and (c) load their
//!   SSA operands before using any scratch. Every other opcode falls through to
//!   `false`, so a forgotten opcode only loses an optimization opportunity — it
//!   can never place a live value in a register the lowering then clobbers.
//! - Because the caller-saved pools (`x12`–`x15`, `d16`–`d23`, `rsi`/`rdi`/`r8`/
//!   `r9`, `xmm2`–`xmm7`) are disjoint from every register the allowlisted
//!   lowerings touch, a value that lives only across allowlisted ops keeps its
//!   caller-saved register intact with no prologue save/restore.
//! - Branch edges with lifetime-tracked parameters are excluded because retaining
//!   a borrowed argument can call the runtime after other parameters are stored.
