//! Purpose:
//! Renders the CLI ini_get, ini_set, and ini_get_all compatibility surface.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - The OPcache prelude facade and sibling rendering modules.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - User declarations and module filters preserve pay-for-use injection.

/// `extension_loaded()` / `get_loaded_extensions()` — LOWERCASED here, so the two cannot drift and
/// the comparison is verbatim against lowercase registry keys (reference PHP does NOT case-fold
/// this argument; do not share a comparison helper with `extension_loaded`, which does). `web`
/// adds `'session'`, the extra module a `--web` binary registers.
///
/// Bridge-linked extensions (`PDO`, `hash`, …) are deliberately NOT included: they are a
/// per-compilation link-set decision made in codegen, while this prelude is built before codegen.

///
/// WHY A SECOND SITE, AND WHY THIS PHASE. `injection::inject_if_used` already gates these three
/// on `detect::program_references`, but it runs in the `opcache-prelude` phase, which is before
/// name resolution and therefore before autoload expansion. The program it sees is the entry
/// file plus its statically resolved includes — and the code that actually calls `ini_set()` is
/// usually neither. Symfony's console entry is 21 lines that mention no INI function at all;
/// `ini_set()` is called from a class the autoload pass splices in at `autoload-run`, so the
/// early gate injected nothing and the binary died with `Call to undefined function ini_set()`.
/// MEASURED on `examples/symfony-app/bin/console`. This is the same placement lesson
/// `error_handling_prelude::inject_if_used` records, and the same phase.
///
/// ONE IMPLEMENTATION, TWO SITES: both call the same `build::cli_ini_*_decl` builders and the
/// same helper blocks. The early site is left in place rather than moved, so a program that DOES
/// name an INI function in its entry file compiles exactly as it did before; this pass then adds
/// only what is still missing. Every piece is guarded by `detect::program_declares` against the
/// post-autoload program, which makes "already injected early" and "the user wrote their own"
/// the same no-op — so the two sites can never both emit the same declaration.
///
/// Returns the program untouched under `--web`: there `web_prelude::build::web_declarations`
/// owns all three names (with the session dispatch layered on top of the shared `opcache.*`
/// helpers), and a second copy would be a redeclaration.
