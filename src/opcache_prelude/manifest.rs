//! Purpose:
//! Builds and renders the compile-time OPcache script manifest.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - The OPcache prelude facade and sibling rendering modules.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Canonical paths, stable ordering, and filesystem metadata remain coupled.

///   (`resolver::resolve_collecting_includes`), already canonical.
/// - `autoloaded_files` are the files the autoload pass loaded — Composer `autoload.files`,
