//! Purpose:
//! Finds the PHP profile a project already declares, so `--php-version` stops being
//! something the user has to remember.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::cli::compile_config`, which owns the entry file path and fills in
//!   `php_version` / `php_version_provenance`.
//!
//! Key details:
//!
//! - EXACT PINS WIN. `composer.lock`'s `platform-overrides.php`,
//!   `composer.json`'s `config.platform.php`, and `.php-version` directly select a profile.
//!   A `require.php` constraint is consulted only when it excludes the newest maintained
//!   profile, in which case the newest admitted profile is selected. The local constraint
//!   parser follows Composer's range semantics instead of Cargo's.
//!
//! - NOTHING IS REQUIRED. Every source is optional at every level, and a project with no
//!   `composer.json` at all resolves to the default exactly as before. Compiling a lone
//!   `.php` file must never need a manifest.
//!
//! - THE SEARCH IS AN UPWARD WALK from the entry file's directory, first hit wins, the way
//!   Cargo and npm find their manifests. Within one directory the sources are tried in
//!   confidence order, so a lockfile pin beats a manifest pin beats a toolchain file.
//!
//! - A PIN OUTSIDE THE MAINTAINED RANGE IS CLAMPED, NOT IGNORED. A project pinning `8.1`
//!   cannot be emulated, but it is still saying "old", so the oldest maintained profile is
//!   the closest honest answer — and the clamp is REPORTED rather than applied silently,
//!   because the difference between what was asked for and what was used is exactly the kind
//!   of thing that must not be discovered later.
