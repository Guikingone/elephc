//! Purpose:
//! Everything about WHICH PHP language profile a compilation targets, and about whether that
//! choice is observable in the program being compiled.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::pipeline::compile()`, to report profile dependence alongside the resolved
//!   profile.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - `--php-version` selects a *semantics profile*, not a compatibility floor. An elephc
//!   binary IS its own runtime: there is no target machine's PHP for it to be compatible
//!   with, so the only question the profile answers is "which PHP's observable behavior
//!   should this binary emulate?".
//! - [`sensitivity`] answers the follow-up question that makes the choice actionable: does
//!   the profile actually change anything *for this program*? For the overwhelming majority
//!   of programs the answer is no, and the compiler stays silent.

/// was built for. That silence is the point of the feature, not a limitation of it: the
/// compiler speaks only when the user has a real choice to make.
///
/// Reported under BOTH provenances. When the profile was assumed, the report says so and
/// suggests pinning it; when the user passed `--php-version`, the report confirms which
/// constructs that flag is actually governing, so an explicit choice is still visible rather
/// than silently doing work the user cannot see.
///
/// # Why these are `note[…]` lines and not warnings
///
/// Nothing here is wrong with the program. Under an explicit `--php-version` the user made a
/// deliberate choice and this only says what that choice governs; even under the default it
/// reports a fact, not a defect. Routing it through `errors::report_warning` would call a
/// correct program's deliberate decision a warning, and would mix these lines into the
/// `warning[line:col]:` stream that test harnesses and users scan for actual problems — see
/// `tests/opcache_ini_tests::elephc_diagnostics`, which deliberately refuses an allow-list so
/// that an UNEXPECTED warning is never hidden. A distinct prefix keeps that property intact.
///
/// `program` must be the USER program — after include resolution but BEFORE any compiler
/// prelude is injected. The `--web` prelude calls `__elephc_php_version_id()` and defines the
/// session surface itself, so scanning after injection would report every `--web` build as
/// profile-dependent on the strength of elephc's own generated code.
