//! Purpose:
//! Defines physical-source loading and the per-file source profile: the language mode selected
//! from a path plus the `declare(strict_types=1)` state that file opted into. Centralizes byte
//! decoding and `.lfc` classification so every loader agrees on source semantics.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::pipeline::compile()` for the entry source.
//! - `crate::resolver` and `crate::autoload` for additional physical source files.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Only `.lfc` opts into tagless elephc source; every other path preserves tagged-PHP behavior.
//! - Classification is ASCII case-insensitive and never changes output-path naming.
//! - `strict_types` is a *per-file* PHP directive. It is stamped onto every `Stmt` created while
//!   one physical file is parsed (`crate::parser::ast::Stmt::strict_types`) and therefore survives
//!   include/autoload merging into the single flat program the type checker sees. Statement
//!   rewriting passes must re-install the profile they read off the statement they are rebuilding,
//!   which is why `with_parse_mode`/`scoped_parse_mode` take the whole `SourceProfile` instead of
//!   the mode alone: a rebuild that dropped the flag would silently downgrade a strict file to
//!   PHP's coercive parameter binding.
