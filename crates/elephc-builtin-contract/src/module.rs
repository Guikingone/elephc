//! Purpose:
//! Names the PHP module (php-src extension) that owns each shared function, class,
//! and constant contract, plus the `Elephc` pseudo-module for surfaces PHP does not have.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - Shared function, class, and constant catalogs (`module` field).
//! - `tools/gen_builtins.rs`, which exports the module name for the compatibility page.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Variants mirror php-src's bundled `ext/` directory as PHP itself reports it through
//!   `ReflectionExtension` / `ReflectionFunction::getExtensionName()`, lowercased, plus the
//!   two surfaces Reflection names differently: `core` (Zend) and `zend opcache`.
//! - `php_name()` is the exact lowercase Reflection spelling, which is also the key the
//!   vendored `scripts/docs/php_baseline.json` snapshot uses, so a catalog module can be
//!   cross-checked against PHP mechanically.
//! - `Elephc` marks elephc-only surfaces (`ptr_*`, `buffer_*`, `zval_*`, `__elephc_*`
//!   internals); they are never counted against a PHP module.
