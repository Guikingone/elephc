//! Purpose:
//! Owns the execution state of every live PHP generator, keyed by its object identity.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::interpreter::generators` for creation, resumption and the Generator protocol.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - A generator's state has to outlive the call that created it, so it lives here rather than
//!   on the stack of the function that produced it. That includes the generator's SCOPE: the
//!   ordinary call path drops its scope at return, which a generator cannot do because its
//!   locals must survive every suspension.
//! - The step list is a flat program with an explicit counter. Resuming is then continuing at
//!   the stored index, with no need to re-descend a statement tree or to replay side effects.
//! - A frame is TAKEN OUT while it runs and put back afterwards, because the body it executes
//!   needs the context mutably and the frame lives inside that context. A generator that tries
//!   to resume itself therefore finds itself absent and fails, rather than corrupting its frame.
