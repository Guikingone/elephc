//! Purpose:
//! Answers "is the eval trace on?" from a cached value instead of the environment, so a DISABLED
//! trace costs one relaxed atomic load rather than a `getenv`.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - every `[elephc-eval-trace]` emission site in the interpreter, the parser and the FFI layer.
//! - `crate::interpreter::builtins::network_env::putenv` to invalidate the cache.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - `ELEPHC_EVAL_TRACE` is read at 100+ sites, several of them per interpreted expression. `getenv`
//!   is not free: on macOS it takes `os_unfair_lock` and linearly scans `environ`, and a Symfony
//!   `--web` worker spent more samples there than anywhere else except the idle wait — for a
//!   facility that was switched OFF.
//! - The cache is INVALIDATED rather than permanent, because PHP's `putenv()` can set the variable
//!   mid-run and a `OnceLock` would then report the old answer forever. Invalidation keeps the
//!   observable behaviour exactly what reading the environment every time gave.
//! - Two questions are cached in one slot because they are answered by one lookup: whether the
//!   variable is set at all, and whether its value selects the FFI-entry trace.
//! - It also carries the one-slot hand-off that lets `phase=include_ok` name the file an include
//!   actually reached; see [`note_include_target`].
