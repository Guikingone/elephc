//! Purpose:
//! Answers class relations for the generated `__elephc_eval_value_is_a` helper when its AOT
//! metadata cannot.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - The generated runtime, through the pointer installed in `_elephc_eval_object_relation_fn`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - `__elephc_eval_value_is_a` decides `instanceof` from the object header's class id alone. An
//!   object the INTERPRETER built carries `stdClass` there whatever class declared it, so every
//!   eval object failed an object type hint on an AOT method's parameter. That is not an edge
//!   case on a Symfony request: the compiled DI container is interpreted, so the loader it hands
//!   to the compiled kernel's `loadRoutes(LoaderInterface $loader)` is an eval object.
//! - RE-ENTRANCY is the whole reason this wrapper exists rather than installing
//!   `__elephc_eval_object_is_a` directly. The interpreter's answer for an eval class with a
//!   NATIVE parent is `values.object_is_a(...)`, which calls straight back into
//!   `__elephc_eval_value_is_a` -- and that now calls here on a false answer. The flag below
//!   bounds the cycle at one level: the inner call declines, the metadata matcher's own answer
//!   stands, and the outer call returns it.
