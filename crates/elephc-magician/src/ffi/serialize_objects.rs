//! Purpose:
//! Renders an EVAL-OWNED object for the generated `serialize()`, which can only read an object's
//! class from its header and its properties from the runtime hash.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - The generated runtime, through the pointer installed in `_elephc_eval_serialize_object_fn`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Every object the interpreter builds carries the `stdClass` class id and an empty property
//!   hash, because its declared properties live in the eval context's overlay. The generated
//!   serializer therefore wrote `O:8:"stdClass":0:{}` for one -- which is what Symfony's
//!   `ConfigCache::write()` put in its routing cache metadata (that method is AOT-compiled, so
//!   its `serialize()` is the generated one), and what the next request read back as a bare
//!   stdClass before refusing it at a `ResourceInterface` parameter.
//! - Only an object with a REGISTERED OWNER context is answered. A native object has none, so
//!   the decision costs one registry lookup on a path that already walks an object header, and
//!   the generated serializer keeps its own rendering for everything it can already render.
//! - LIMITATION: the fragment is rendered by the interpreter's own serializer, which numbers the
//!   `r:<index>` back-references of anything NESTED inside the object independently of the
//!   generated serializer's table. An object repeated both inside and outside a delegated
//!   subtree would not be emitted as a back-reference. Everything else round-trips.
