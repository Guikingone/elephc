//! Purpose:
//! Defines stable integer status codes returned by the eval bridge ABI.
//! Keeps Rust error shapes internal while exposing C-compatible outcomes.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::__elephc_eval_execute()`
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Numeric values are part of the ABI contract and must remain stable.
