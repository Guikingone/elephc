//! Purpose:
//! Interpreter tests for a method that stores one of its arguments into `$this` AND returns a
//! freshly constructed object of a DIFFERENT class built from that same argument, called as a
//! discarded statement.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test -p elephc-magician` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - `php -n` 8.5.6 is the oracle for every literal string asserted here.
//! - The fake runtime counts references (`FakeOps`), so a missing retain leaves a handle's count
//!   too LOW instead of panicking outright here -- see `crates/elephc-magician/src/interpreter/
//!   tests/support/mod.rs`. The undercount is exactly the retain `eval_property_array_append_result`
//!   (and its siblings) owed the appended value before handing it to the CONSUMING `array_set`.

/// Verifies `$this->prop[] = $arg;` followed by returning `new Other($arg)` (a DIFFERENT class,

/// reference, not the call argument's only one.
///
/// `php -n` 8.5.6 prints `a` for `$r->seen[0]`. Tracing the fake's own accounting for this exact
/// script: the call argument starts at 1 (the caller's own temp); writing a promoted property on a
/// dynamically-declared object retains TWICE (the native-slot mirror in
/// `eval_property_set_result` and the interpreter's own overlay in
/// `eval_store_dynamic_property_value` each take an independent reference), taking it to 3; the
/// method's own `release_owned_bound_args` then pays back the call argument's debt, taking it to 2;
/// and this test's own `return $r->seen[0]` mints one more owned read, landing on 3 -- UNLESS the
/// array append also minted its own reference for the array's hold, which is the ONE retain this
/// family of defect is missing. With that retain the running count is 4, not 3: appending an
/// ALIASED argument straight into `values.array_set` (a CONSUMING sink) without retaining first
/// hands the array the SAME physical reference the call-argument cleanup and the promoted property
/// already account for, so the count comes back short by exactly one -- the array holds a
/// reference nobody minted for it, which is exactly what leaves it pointing at freed memory once
/// the constructed object's own copy is torn down in the compiled runtime.
