//! Purpose:
//! Pins `use (&$x)` closure captures to the CELL `$x` names at closure-creation time, not the
//! NAME `$x`: rebinding or unsetting `$x` afterward must not affect the closure's own captured
//! storage, and multiple closures created from the same variable name across loop iterations
//! must never contaminate each other's captured cell.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test -p elephc-magician interpreter::tests::closure_by_ref_capture_cell_identity`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Every expected string is `php -n` 8.5.6's output on the same fragment.
//! - The bug: `eval_call_arg_value`'s `LoadVar` arm always manufactured a fresh
//!   `EvalReferenceTarget::Variable { scope, name }` node for a by-reference capture, even when
//!   `name` was already itself a reference (bound via `$x = &$arr[];` or a by-reference
//!   `foreach`). Write-back then re-resolved the caller-side target by NAME at call time instead
//!   of by the CELL captured at closure-creation time, so a later rebind or unset of that name
//!   redirected -- or lost -- a write the closure had already earned. This is the read/capture
//!   mirror of `90c3d5a5ec`'s write-side fix (`write_back_method_ref_target`'s `Variable` arm
//!   now follows `scope.reference_target(name)` before writing).
