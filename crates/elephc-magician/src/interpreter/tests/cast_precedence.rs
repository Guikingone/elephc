//! Purpose:
//! Interpreter tests pinning what a CAST evaluates to when an operator follows it, and what an
//! int cast makes of a string that only starts with a number.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test -p elephc-magician interpreter::tests::cast_precedence`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Every expected string is `php -n` 8.5.6's output on the same fragment.
//! - These were SILENT WRONG VALUES rather than refusals, which is why they are worth their own
//!   file: a refusal stops the program and says where, a wrong number reaches the page.
//! - TWO defects that compounded. The parser took the cast's operand with `parse_concat`, so the
//!   cast swallowed the whole concatenation and every additive term in it; and the fixture's
//!   string-to-number conversion parsed the WHOLE string instead of its leading numeric prefix.
//!   `(int) $a . "4x"` with `$a = "3"` printed `0`: the cast took `"34x"` and then the fixture
//!   made 0 of it. Fixing either alone still prints the wrong answer.
//! - The second is a FAKE-RUNTIME defect, not an interpreter one. The compiled backend already
//!   answers php's way -- `tests/ir_backend_smoke_test.rs` pins `intval("42xyz")` at `42` -- so
//!   only the fixture diverged, and it diverged for every numeric use of a string.
