//! Purpose:
//! Interpreter tests pinning that a refused construct SAYS what it was, instead of failing with
//! eleven fixed words.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test -p elephc-magician interpreter::tests::refusal_diagnostics`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Measured, not guessed: of php-src's 2556-case language corpus, 225 ended in a bare
//!   `Fatal error: eval() runtime failed` with no phase, no name and no line. That is not a
//!   severity problem, it is a GROUPING problem -- a quarter of the corpus could not be sorted
//!   into causes at all, so none of it could be worked on.
//! - Descriptions are first-writer-wins and the innermost frame writes first, so a path that
//!   already names itself keeps its own message. These fallbacks only ever land on a failure that
//!   nothing inside it described.
//! - After the change the same 225 sort into 24 named groups, the largest being
//!   `unsupported Call expression` (50) and `class <N> could not be declared` (40).
