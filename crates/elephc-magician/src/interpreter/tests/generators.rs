//! Purpose:
//! Interpreter tests for PHP generators: the object a function containing `yield` returns, its
//! resumption protocol, key numbering, `yield from` delegation and the errors PHP raises.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test -p elephc-magician interpreter::tests::generators`.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - A named `function g() { yield 1; }` used to die with
//!   `call to undefined function __elephc_eval_yield()`, because only closures were lowered and
//!   they were lowered EAGERLY into an `ArrayIterator`, which re-evaluated every yielded
//!   expression and could not model an infinite generator, `send()` or `yield from`.
//! - The key rules are the ones that catch a re-implementation: an explicit key does not advance
//!   the auto-increment counter, `yield from` preserves the INNER keys and leaves the outer
//!   counter alone, and every generator in a delegation chain numbers its own.
//! - Every expected string is `php -n` 8.5.6's output on the same fragment.
