//! Purpose:
//! Eval registry entry and implementation for `extension_loaded`.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::interpreter::builtins::network_env` direct and by-value dispatch.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Membership is resolved against a compile-time-known extension set, matching the native
//!   codegen behavior; there is no runtime extension state in this increment.
//! - Matching is case-insensitive over the canonical extension names.

/// Eval's set of "loaded" PHP extensions, DERIVED from the shared catalog exactly as the AOT
/// backend derives its own.
///
/// An extension is reported only when BOTH shared facts hold:
///
/// 1. `PhpModule::covers_php_function_surface()` — elephc's catalog declares php-src's entire
///    function list for it. `extension_loaded()` promises that all of an extension's functions
///    are callable, and a partial surface cannot make that promise. This is why `mbstring`
///    (2 of php's 65 `mb_*`), `ctype` (4 of 11) and `posix` (2 of 41) are no longer listed.
///    `PhpModule::is_engine_surface()` admits `Core`, `standard` and `pcre` despite partial
///    coverage; its doc comment carries the argument.
/// 2. Every one of the module's functions has a Magician implementation
///    (`eval_support(...) == Implemented`), which is the interpreter's OWN declaration of its
///    surface and is already enforced against real bindings by the registry gate.
///
/// Fact 2 is what keeps this list from claiming a surface the AOT backend provides through a
/// linked bridge or an injected prelude that eval has no access to: the eval interpreter runs at
/// compile time with no AOT link manifest, so `extension_loaded('PDO')` stays `false` under eval
/// even when the surrounding program is compiled `--with-pdo`. `xml` / `xmlwriter` and `curl` are
/// the two host-dependent answers, handled in [`eval_extension_is_loaded_in`] and below.
