//! Purpose:
//! Regression tests for call-site parameter type inference of untyped parameters.
//! Ensures a parameter called with heterogeneous argument types is inferred as
//! `Mixed` (boxed), not collapsed to a single type that mis-tags scalar arguments.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - The bug surfaced via PDO `bindValue` with mixed `?`/`:name` placeholders: an
//!   int argument passed to a param that another call site passed a string to was
//!   coerced to a string, so `is_int` returned false and values were corrupted.
