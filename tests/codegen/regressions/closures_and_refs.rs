//! Purpose:
//! Integration or regression tests for end-to-end codegen coverage of regressions closures and refs, including closure default param, closure default param overridden, and for compound subtract.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Inline PHP fixtures are compiled to native binaries and assertions compare stdout or expected failures.

/// reuses ONE local — and `$temp = null` on an already-reference-bound name writes THROUGH the
/// existing cell instead of rebinding it. Every element a loop appended then aliased the same
/// cell, so the array ended up holding the LAST iteration's value in every slot:
///
///     foreach ([1, 2, 3] as $i) { $c = &$opt[]; $c = $i; }   // 3,3,3 instead of 1,2,3
///
/// The desugaring now ends with `unset($temp)`. It has to come LAST: lowering walks the block
/// ONCE and `unset_local` only emits `Op::UnsetLocal` for a name that is ref-bound AT LOWERING
/// TIME, so a leading `unset` lowered to nothing and changed nothing at all.
///
/// Symfony's `EventDispatcher::optimizeListeners` writes `$closure = &$this->optimized[$e][]` once
/// per listener, so a shared cell made every event dispatch its LAST listener over and over.
///
/// The fixture reads the elements back through `foreach`, which follows a reference element.
/// `json_encode`/`implode`/`in_array` do NOT follow one — a separate, still-open gap that this
/// test deliberately does not assert.
///
/// Oracle: `php -n` prints the asserted lines.
