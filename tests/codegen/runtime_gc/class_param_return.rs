//! Purpose:
//! End-to-end regressions for issue #1203: a function that returns a CLASS-typed parameter made
//! the caller release storage it only lent.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test --test codegen_tests class_param_return` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - The summary was always right; the CONSUMER never asked it.
//!   `value_is_borrowed_user_call_result` refuses when the argument is an owning temporary, and
//!   `value_is_owned_unboxed_local_load` answers true for any `LoadLocal` of a `PhpLocal` slot
//!   holding an object, array, assoc array or iterable. That answer is provisional — it exists so
//!   a later store can widen the slot — and the caller owes no release on the load itself.
//! - A `mixed`-typed load matches neither clause of that predicate and stays `maybe_owned`, which
//!   is why the same shape was already correct for `mixed` (#992) and not for a class type.
//! - The predicate covers `Array`, `AssocArray`, `Object` and `Iterable`, but only the OBJECT
//!   form was observably broken: the array fixture below passes with the fix reverted. It is kept
//!   as a guard that the fix did not disturb the shapes that were already right.
//! - Two call sites are required: a single call is inlined, which removes the boundary. The
//!   argument must reach the callee through a LOCAL; nested directly (`ident(pick($i))`) it is a
//!   genuine owning temporary and takes the other path, which must keep refusing (#486).
