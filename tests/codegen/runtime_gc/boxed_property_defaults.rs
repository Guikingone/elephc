//! Purpose:
//! Regression tests for issue #688: an array literal defaulting a `mixed` or union-typed
//! property allocates its container and then boxes it into a Mixed cell, and the box takes
//! its OWN reference — so the object-construction path must use the owned boxer.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Each fixture runs under `--heap-debug` and asserts `leak summary: clean`.
//! - Objects are constructed in a LOOP on purpose: the plain boxer retains without
//!   releasing and leaks exactly one block per object, which a single construction hides.
//! - Both literal spellings are covered together — keyed (`["k" => 1]`) and positional
//!   (`[1, 2]`) reach different emitters — so a future change cannot fix one and lose the
//!   other's ownership.

use crate::support::compile_and_run_with_heap_debug;

/// Verifies the boxed array-literal defaults release the container they allocate.
///
/// Each object allocates the literal and boxes it into a Mixed cell, and the box takes its own
/// reference — so the OWNED boxer is required. The plain one retains without releasing and leaks
/// one block per object, which a single-iteration total hides.
