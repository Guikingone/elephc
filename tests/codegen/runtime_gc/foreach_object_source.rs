//! Purpose:
//! Regression tests for the reference a `foreach` loop holds on an *object*
//! source — a `Generator`, or a user class implementing `Iterator`. That
//! reference used to be taken by a bare backend `incref` inside `Op::IterStart`
//! that nothing ever balanced, so every such loop leaked the iterated object
//! and every heap block it owned.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Each fixture runs under `--heap-debug` and asserts `leak summary: clean`,
//!   so a reintroduced imbalance fails here instead of silently growing the heap.
//! - The reference is now an `Op::Acquire` released by the loop's exit block and
//!   its `LoopCleanup`, which is also what keeps `unset($it)` inside the body
//!   from freeing the object mid-iteration — hence the `unset` fixtures, which
//!   would regress into a use-after-free if the acquire were simply dropped.
//! - Expected stdout is real `LC_ALL=C php` 8.4 output.
