//! Purpose:
//! Heap-debug regression coverage for owned `parse_url()` array and component results.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test --test codegen_tests runtime_gc::parse_url` through the runtime-GC suite.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Each iteration releases both a Mixed-valued hash and a selected owned string,
//!   exercising copied component payloads and the Mixed cells stored inside the hash.

use crate::support::*;

/// Verifies repeated full-array and selected-string results release every owned allocation.
