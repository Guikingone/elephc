//! Purpose:
//! End-to-end value tests for `foreach` over an object that implements neither Iterator
//! interface, and for the order every enumerator reports an object's dynamic properties in.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test --test codegen_tests eval_foreach_object` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - PHP iterates the properties VISIBLE FROM THE CALLING SCOPE, so the same object yields a
//!   different set inside a method than outside the class. Both are covered, because a rule
//!   that only looks right from one side is the failure these tests exist to catch.
//! - Dynamic properties come back in CREATION order, so every fixture adds them out of
//!   alphabetical order on purpose: a store that cannot remember insertion order, or one that
//!   sorts to look deterministic, fails here and only here.
//! - Every expected string is `php -n` 8.5.6's output. PHP also emits `Deprecated: Creation of
//!   dynamic property C::$p is deprecated`; that goes to stderr, not stdout.
