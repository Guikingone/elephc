//! Purpose:
//! Integration or regression tests for the call-stack overflow guard: unbounded recursion
//! must end in a controlled fatal on stderr with a non-zero exit instead of a raw SIGSEGV,
//! while legitimately deep recursion must keep working on both the OS stack and the
//! coroutine stacks used by generators and fibers.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Inline PHP fixtures are compiled to native binaries; the failure cases assert on the
//!   stderr text and on the mere fact that the process did not succeed, because a raw
//!   signal death would also be non-zero — the message is what proves the guard fired.
//! - The "still succeeds" cases are the false-positive gate: they must stay comfortably
//!   under the real limits (roughly 50k frames on a default 8 MiB OS stack and roughly 1k
//!   frames on a 256 KiB fiber stack) so the reserve can never make them flaky.
