//! Purpose:
//! End-to-end tests for the classes PHP refuses to serialize or unserialize: the builtin set
//! php-src flags `ZEND_ACC_NOT_SERIALIZABLE` that elephc registers, subclasses of those, and
//! Closure values.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test --test codegen_tests` through the serialize codegen test module.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Expected output was measured on PHP 8.5.10 (Phar cases with `phar.readonly=0`), except the
//!   user classes named after internals elephc does not model, which PHP rejects at declaration.
//! - A refused class must throw even when the program never names it, since the wire string alone
//!   decides which class `unserialize()` meets.
//! - Only elephc's own declaration of a builtin is refused: a program that does not load the curl
//!   or PDO prelude may declare a class with one of their names, and that class round-trips.
//! - `unserialize()` refuses from its allocation-free preflight, so a caught refusal leaves nothing
//!   behind and runs no hook of the payload, which `--heap-debug` pins.
