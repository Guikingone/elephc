//! Purpose:
//! End-to-end value tests for DYNAMIC properties — created by `$object->name = ...` rather than
//! declared — on objects the interpreter owns, where every reader has to agree about the same
//! object.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test --test codegen_tests eval_dynamic_properties` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - An interpreter-declared object keeps its properties in the interpreter's own per-object
//!   store, while `print_r`, `var_dump`, `json_encode`, `get_object_vars` and the reflection
//!   listings all walk the runtime object's slots. A value written to only one of the two is
//!   silently absent from whichever half does not look there, which is why the readers are
//!   exercised together rather than one per test.
//! - The runtime-include case matters on its own: that is the shape an autoloader produces, and
//!   the include path is deliberately not a literal so the file is chosen at run time.
//! - Every expected string is `php -n` 8.5.6's output. PHP also emits `Deprecated: Creation of
//!   dynamic property C::$p is deprecated` for a class without `#[AllowDynamicProperties]`;
//!   that goes to stderr, not stdout, so it is absent from these expectations.
