//! Purpose:
//! Wires shared codegen test support helpers and cached target/runtime state.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Exports platform, compiler, runner, and project helpers used by end-to-end codegen fixtures.

/// Removes a codegen test's temporary directory even when the test panics.

/// The directory used to be deleted only on the way out of `compile_and_run`, so ANY panic before
/// that -- a compile refusal, an assembler or linker failure, an assertion inside the harness --
/// leaked the `.s`, the `.o` and the linked binary it held. Measured on one full `codegen::eval`
/// run: 3092 leftover `elephc_test_*` directories in TMPDIR and free disk down from 20 GiB to 7.
///
/// That is a feedback loop, not just untidiness. Once the disk is short, compiles that would have
/// passed start failing for want of space, and every one of THOSE leaks another directory. The
/// same run's failure rate climbed from 3% to 49% as it went, which is what a contaminated census
/// looks like -- and it is why a number from such a run cannot be trusted as a branch-tip
/// measurement.
///
/// `ELEPHC_TEST_KEEP=1` keeps the directory and prints where it is, which is how to inspect the
/// assembly of a case that is genuinely failing.
