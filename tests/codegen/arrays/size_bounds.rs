//! Purpose:
//! Regression tests for the maximum-size bounds reference PHP enforces on `array_fill()`'s
//! `$count` and on `range()`'s element count — the ones it reports as a catchable `ValueError`
//! rather than as an allocation fatal.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Every expected string in this file is verbatim `LC_ALL=C php` 8.4.20 output for the same
//!   fixture, including `range()`'s message, which interpolates the NORMALIZED interval: the
//!   smaller endpoint as `start=`, the larger as `end=`, and `abs($step)` as `step=`.
//! - The two bounds are deliberately different, because php-src's are: `array_fill()` is checked
//!   against `INT_MAX` (`2147483647` builds, `2147483648` throws) while `range()` is checked
//!   against the maximum array size (`1073741823` elements build, `1073741824` throw). Both
//!   boundaries are asserted from the rejected side here and from the accepted side by the
//!   heap-exhaustion fixtures in `arrays::allocation_guards`.
//! - The accepted side of each boundary is never executed for its result: reference PHP accepts
//!   it and then fails on memory, and so does elephc, but the attempt would ask this process for
//!   an 8 GiB payload.
//! - `range()`'s three `$step` `ValueError`s are checked before the size one in php-src, so the
//!   fixtures that would trip both assert the step wording.
