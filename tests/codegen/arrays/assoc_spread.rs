//! Purpose:
//! Regression tests for keys an associative-array spread contributes: a dynamic read, a read the
//! folder must not answer from the literal, and a spread nested inside a callable's argument array.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Every expected value is verbatim `LC_ALL=C php` output from PHP 8.4.20.
//! - A literal that mixes explicit keys with a spread is `ExprKind::ArrayLiteralMixed`, an
//!   ordered entry list; neither single-shape node can hold it. A pass that only special-cases
//!   `ArrayLiteralAssoc` must therefore leave the mixed node dynamic, which is what stops the
//!   effect analysis from calling a spread-supplied key a statically missing offset and the
//!   folder from answering an access from the literal entry the spread overwrites.
