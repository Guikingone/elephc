//! Purpose:
//! Regression tests for element references taken through a BOXED receiver: a `mixed`
//! parameter or local, or a declared `array` parameter (boxed on this branch so its
//! representation can change without retyping the caller's slot).
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - PHP separates an array the moment one of its elements becomes a reference, so an alias
//!   taken BEFORE `$r = &$a[...]` must keep the original value. The boxed lowering rewrote the
//!   shared cell in place and every alias saw the reference and the writes through it.
//! - The packed case additionally promotes the payload to a hash; the promoted hash is now
//!   published into the cell before the packed owner is released, so heap debug stays clean
//!   and nothing observes the cell pointing at freed storage.
//! - Every expected value is real `php` 8.x output for the same fixture.
