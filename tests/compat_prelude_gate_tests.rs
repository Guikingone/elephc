//! Purpose:
//! Guards the PHASE at which a usage-gated compatibility prelude is injected. A surface named
//! only by a class the AUTOLOADER brings in must still be declared — the gate runs against the
//! complete closed-world program, not against the entry file.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test --test compat_prelude_gate_tests` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - This suite exists because every other prelude test is SINGLE-FILE, and a single-file probe
//!   cannot see the bug. The CLI error prelude was injected in the `web-prelude` phase, whose
//!   gate saw only the 21-line entry script; nothing was injected and the binary died at run
//!   time on `Call to undefined function error_reporting()`. The declaration it needed lived in
//!   a class the autoload pass splices in ~90 lines further down `src/pipeline.rs`, in the
//!   `compat-preludes` phase. Neither the 52 `--web` tests nor the 8 CLI error-surface tests
//!   caught it.
//! - The tell is encoded below as a pair: a `require`d file IS visible to a gate in the early
//!   phase, an AUTOLOADED class is NOT. `a_required_second_file_gates_the_prelude_too` passed
//!   throughout the bug; `an_autoloaded_class_gates_the_prelude` is the one that failed.
//! - The assembly assertions distinguish the two failure modes a run alone confuses: the NAME
//!   appears either way, because the runtime's undefined-function message carries it. Only a
//!   symbol the prelude DECLARES (`__elephc_diag_render`) proves the declaration was compiled.
//! - The error-handling surface is used as the probe because it is the one that broke, but the
//!   property under test belongs to the phase, not to that surface: any usage-gated prelude
//!   injected in `compat-preludes` inherits these assertions.
//! - The assertions are not vacuous, and the neighbouring project proves it rather than a
//!   mutation: on the same three-file shape, the autoloaded class NAMING the surface emits
//!   1 036 342 bytes of assembly with 82 `__elephc_diag_render` hits, and the one naming nothing
//!   emits 161 650 bytes with 0. The counted symbol therefore reaches zero on an input one line
//!   away from the passing case. Every expected string was captured from `php 8.5.10`:
//!   `php -r '$l = error_reporting(); ...'` prints `level=E_ALL handler=yes`.
