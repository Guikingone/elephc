//! Purpose:
//! Guards the shape every PHP polyfill ships: an eager `autoload.files` entry that declares global
//! functions behind `if (!function_exists('f'))`. One hop works; two hops do not, and the second
//! test pins exactly where the boundary is.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test --test eager_file_polyfill_tests` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Conditional declarations in an INCLUDED file are dropped unless
//!   `ELEPHC_BIND_CONDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DECLARATIONS=1`, which is off by default and blocked on
//!   array-element references (`resolver::declarations::conditional_include_declarations_are_bound`).
//!   An eager file's OWN conditional declarations are not on that path and survive, which is why
//!   the one-hop test passes and the two-hop one does not.
//! - MEASURED, and the reason the two-hop case is `#[ignore]` rather than absent: the same fixture
//!   prints `AB` under a compiler frozen on 2026-09-21 and fatals with `Call to undefined function
//!   probe_upper()` on the current tree. It is a live regression, it is not caused by anything in
//!   the same change as this file, and removing every line of that change leaves it unchanged.
//! - `function_exists` cannot be used to observe any of this: it answers false for
//!   interpreter-declared functions even when calling them works. These tests CALL the function.
//! - Symfony's `/` route dies on exactly this shape --
//!   `polyfill-mbstring/bootstrap.php` -> `return require __DIR__.'/bootstrap80.php'` -> guarded
//!   `mb_*` declarations -- traced as `phase=compiler_included_skip` on the first file.
