## elephc\async\run()

```php
function elephc\async\run(callable $body): mixed
```

Runs a structured cooperative task scope to completion.

**Parameters**:
- `$body` (`callable`)

**Returns**: `mixed`

## Availability

- **Compiled (AOT)**: supported through an injected elephc-PHP prelude.
- **`eval()` (magician interpreter)**: not available inside eval'd code.
- **Strict PHP mode**: hidden — this builtin is an elephc extension with no PHP equivalent, so programs compiled with [`--strict-php`](../../../compiling/cli-reference.md#strict-php-mode) treat the name as nonexistent, in compiled code and inside eval'd code.

**Examples**:

examples/async-scheduler/main.php

## Internals
